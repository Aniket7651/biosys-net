Hi I'm Aniket yadav,

	Welcome to my software program which is a type of computational biology and bioinformatics tool, this is a Console based
	application not includes user interface now but, I can try with UI also at next time.
		According to NCBI, Bioinformatics is defined as the application of tools of computation and analysis to 
	the capture and interpretation of biological data. It is an interdisciplinary field, which harnesses computer 
	science, mathematics, physics, and biology. Bioinformatics is essential for management of data in modern biology 
	and medicine.
	This is the easy and suitable way to analyse a large number of DNAs, RNAs and protein sequence.
	application contains number of folder like:
		
				|- BioSyS_Tool
					|- bin\Debug\net6.0
						|- docs
							|- samples
								|- samples
									|- 
							|- help.txt
							|- License.txt
